RESEARCH REQUEST
================

CONTEXT:
We are developing the NOLA Design System, a comprehensive educational design system built with Next.js, TypeScript, Storybook, and Tailwind CSS. The system provides age-appropriate, accessible UI components with interactive documentation and a distributable component registry compatible with shadcn CLI. Our key challenge is implementing a robust theming system that can distribute theme layers and components via JSON to consuming developers.

As of September 2025, we need to understand the current best practices for constructing, applying, and exporting Tailwind and shadcn/ui themes. We're looking for real-world examples and proven patterns from other developers and repositories who have successfully implemented similar theme distribution systems. The goal is to avoid reinventing the wheel and leverage existing solutions that have been battle-tested in production environments.

Our specific requirements include: creating multiple educational themes (Foundation, Pathways, Professional), enabling theme preview and switching in our Storybook documentation, distributing themes through our registry system, and ensuring themes work seamlessly when installed via the shadcn CLI. We need to understand how to properly structure CSS variables, Tailwind configurations, and component variants to support this multi-theme architecture.

RESEARCH QUESTIONS:

1. What are the most successful real-world implementations of multi-theme systems using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui as of 2025? Please identify specific GitHub repositories, npm packages, or production applications that demonstrate best practices for theme layering and distribution.

2. How are leading design systems structuring their theme tokens and CSS variables to support dynamic theme switching while maintaining type safety in TypeScript? What patterns have emerged for organizing color scales, typography, spacing, and component-specific tokens?

3. What are the current best practices for distributing themes via JSON configuration files that can be consumed by the shadcn CLI? How do successful projects handle theme dependencies, variant definitions, and registry metadata?

4. How do modern design systems implement theme preview and switching capabilities in Storybook v9.x environments? What addons, decorators, or custom implementations are being used to showcase multiple themes simultaneously?

5. What approaches are being used to export and package themes for consumption by external projects? How do successful implementations handle CSS layer ordering, Tailwind configuration merging, and PostCSS processing?

6. What are the latest techniques for implementing educational or age-appropriate theming in 2025? Are there specific accessibility considerations or WCAG guidelines that have emerged for educational design systems?

7. How are teams handling theme versioning and backwards compatibility when distributing themes through component registries? What strategies exist for managing breaking changes in theme structures?

8. What performance optimization strategies are being employed for multi-theme systems in Next.js 15.x applications? How are developers minimizing CSS bundle sizes while supporting multiple theme variants?

9. What testing strategies have proven effective for validating theme implementations across different components and contexts? Are there specific tools or methodologies for visual regression testing of themed components?

10. What are the emerging patterns for theme composition and extension as of September 2025? How are developers enabling consumers to customize distributed themes while maintaining upgrade paths?

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Focus on implementations from 2024-2025 to ensure relevance with current tooling versions
- Prioritize examples that include educational or accessibility-focused design systems
- Look for solutions that integrate with both Storybook documentation and production applications
- Consider both open-source and commercial implementations that share their architecture publicly
- Include examples that demonstrate CI/CD integration for theme distribution
- Investigate any new shadcn/ui theme features or registry capabilities introduced in 2025

PREFERRED SOURCES:
- GitHub repositories with active maintenance and comprehensive documentation
- Technical blog posts or case studies from teams implementing similar systems
- Official documentation from Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and Storybook regarding theme implementation
- Conference talks or workshops from 2024-2025 covering design system architecture
- npm packages that provide theme distribution solutions for component libraries
