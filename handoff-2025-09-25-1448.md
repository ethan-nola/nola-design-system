# Claude Code Session Handoff
*Generated: 2025-09-25 14:48:32*

## Executive Summary

This session focused on implementing an educational theme system for the NOLA Design System. The primary objective was to create 3 age-appropriate themes (Foundation for ages 11-14, Pathways for ages 14-18, and Professional for ages 18+) with theme-switching capabilities for both the Next.js application and Storybook documentation. All planning and specification work has been completed, with comprehensive documentation created in the `/specs/001-we-should-create/` directory. The project is now ready to proceed to task generation and implementation phases.

The session successfully addressed key technical decisions around CSS custom properties integration, Storybook addon configuration, and multi-theme performance optimization using a 3-tier token architecture. All constitutional principles were validated, and the approach maintains compatibility with the existing shadcn/ui ecosystem while introducing educational accessibility features.

- **API Contracts** (`/specs/001-we-should-create/contracts/theme-api.md`): CSS custom properties contracts, theme switching API, and Storybook integration specifications
- **Implementation Guide** (`/specs/001-we-should-create/quickstart.md`): Step-by-step development workflow with specific addon instructions and validation checklists

### Enhanced Multi-Theme Architecture
- Integrated insights from comprehensive Multi-Theme Best Practices research document
- Adopted `@storybook/addon-themes` with `withThemeByClassName` decorator for documentation
- Established 3-tier token structure for maintainability and scalability
- Defined age-appropriate design specifications with accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Agent Context Updates
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with current technology stack and recent changes
- Maintained consistency with existing development guidelines

## Technical Decisions

### Core Architecture Choices
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Extend existing globals.css pattern for theme variables instead of Tailwind configuration variants
- **next-themes Integration**: Leverage existing 0.4.6 installation with custom theme names ('foundation', 'pathways', 'professional')
- **Storybook Integration**: Use `@storybook/addon-themes` with `withThemeByClassName` decorator (requires installation)
- **Storage Strategy**: localStorage persistence via next-themes, defaulting to base shadcn/ui theme

### Educational Design Tokens
- **Foundation Theme (Ages 11-14)**: 48px minimum touch targets, enhanced contrast (7:1 preferred), 16px base font, 3px focus indicators
- **Pathways Theme (Ages 14-18)**: Standard 44px touch targets, WCAG AA compliance (4.5:1), 15px base font, 2px focus indicators
- **Professional Theme (Ages 18+)**: Compact 40px touch targets, efficient design (14px base font), subtle 1px focus indicators

### Theme Distribution Strategy
- **3-Tier Token Architecture**: Raw tokens → Semantic mappings → Component overrides
- **Versioning Support**: Semantic versioning with `--theme-version` metadata in CSS
- **Registry Compatibility**: Themes distributed as JSON entries compatible with shadcn CLI
- **Performance Optimization**: CSS custom properties prevent style duplication across themes

### Accessibility and Compliance
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all themes with enhanced standards for Foundation theme
- Age-appropriate color palettes with vibrant but accessible contrast ratios
- Touch target specifications meeting educational usability requirements
- Light mode only for v1 (educational themes exclude dark variants initially)

## Unfinished Business

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Generate Implementation Tasks**: Run `/tasks` command to create `tasks.md` from completed specifications
2. **Install Dependencies**: Add `@storybook/addon-themes` package (required for Storybook integration)
3. **Implement CSS Architecture**: Create 3-tier token structure in globals.css
4. **Configure Theme Switching**: Update next-themes and Storybook configurations with new theme names

### Known Issues
- No current blocking issues identified
- All specification clarifications resolved (default theme, touch targets, persistence, dark mode scope)
- Constitutional compliance validated with zero violations

### Pending Decisions
- No major technical decisions pending - all architectural choices documented and validated
- Minor consideration: Whether to include theme validation tests in initial implementation or add in subsequent iteration

## Code Changes Summary

### New Documentation Files
- `/specs/001-we-should-create/spec.md` - Complete feature specification with resolved user requirements
- `/specs/001-we-should-create/plan.md` - Implementation plan with constitutional validation
- `/specs/001-we-should-create/research.md` - Technology decisions and best practices analysis

## Next Session Recommendations

### First Actions
1. **Generate Task List**: Execute `/tasks` command to create implementation tasks from completed specifications
   ```bash
   # This will create tasks.md with 18-22 ordered implementation tasks
   /tasks
   ```

2. **Verify Current State**: Confirm development environment is ready
   ```bash
   bun dev          # Terminal 1: Next.js development server
   bun storybook    # Terminal 2: Storybook documentation
   ```

3. **Begin Implementation**: Follow task order starting with dependency installation
   ```bash
   bun add -D @storybook/addon-themes
   ```

### Context to Review
- **Implementation Guide**: `/specs/001-we-should-create/quickstart.md` contains step-by-step development workflow
- **API Contracts**: Review `/specs/001-we-should-create/contracts/theme-api.md` for specific CSS variable requirements
- **Multi-Theme Best Practices**: Reference insights from industry research for implementation details
- **Data Model**: Understanding 3-tier token architecture will guide CSS implementation

### Warnings
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Maintain upstream-first approach - do not modify core shadcn/ui components
- **Performance**: Use CSS custom properties pattern to avoid style duplication across themes
- **Accessibility**: All color pairs must meet specified contrast requirements per theme
- **Dependency Management**: `@storybook/addon-themes` is required but not yet installed
- **Theme Validation**: Test all themes across existing component library to ensure compatibility

## Additional Notes

### Current Branch Status
Working on feature branch `001-we-should-create` with all specification documents complete. The branch includes comprehensive planning documentation and is ready for implementation phase.
