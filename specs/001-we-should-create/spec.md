# Feature Specification: Educational Theme System

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-should-create`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Ready for Planning
**Input**: User description: "We should create a spec for building our 3 themes. the result should be the ability to theme-switch in our app and storybook preview. We should not build new components or stories. we'll test our themes using the existing software and stories. The entire goal is to build the themes, not create new UI components, previews, routes or any other updates to the application other than is whet is required to design the themes and preview them using the existing architecture."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an educational platform developer, I need to apply age-appropriate themes to my UI components so that the interface matches the cognitive and visual needs of my target age group (middle school, high school, or post-graduate learners).

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the default theme is loaded, **When** a developer selects the Foundation theme, **Then** all UI components should display with larger touch targets, higher contrast, and vibrant colors appropriate for middle school students (ages 11-14)

2. **Given** any theme is active, **When** a developer switches to the Pathways theme, **Then** all UI components should display with modern design patterns and balanced spacing appropriate for high school students (ages 14-18)

3. **Given** any theme is active, **When** a developer switches to the Professional theme, **Then** all UI components should display with sophisticated, information-dense layouts appropriate for post-graduate learners (ages 18+)

4. **Given** the application is running locally, **When** a developer toggles between themes, **Then** the theme change should apply immediately without page refresh and persist across navigation

5. **Given** the Storybook documentation is open, **When** a developer selects a different theme, **Then** all component stories should immediately reflect the new theme's visual properties

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no theme is explicitly selected? The system defaults to the base shadcn/ui theme without any educational modifications.
- How does the system handle theme switching during form input or user interactions?
- What happens if a user's browser doesn't support the required CSS features for theming?
- How does the theme persist across sessions? Theme selection is stored in localStorage for persistence across browser sessions.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide three distinct educational themes: Foundation (ages 11-14), Pathways (ages 14-18), and Professional (ages 18+)

- **FR-002**: Each theme MUST maintain complete visual consistency across all existing UI components without requiring component code modifications

- **FR-003**: Developers MUST be able to switch between themes in the main application during runtime

- **FR-004**: Developers MUST be able to preview all themes in the Storybook documentation environment

- **FR-005**: Theme switching MUST preserve all component functionality and user interactions

- **FR-006**: Each theme MUST include appropriate design tokens for colors, typography, spacing, border radius, shadows, and interactive states

- **FR-007**: Foundation theme MUST provide larger touch targets (minimum 48px), higher color contrast ratios, and more prominent visual feedback for interactions

- **FR-008**: Pathways theme MUST provide balanced visual hierarchy with modern design aesthetics suitable for teenage users

- **FR-009**: Professional theme MUST support information-dense layouts with refined typography and subtle visual treatments

- **FR-010**: All themes MUST maintain WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance

- **FR-011**: Theme changes MUST apply to light mode only in v1 (educational themes will not include dark mode variants initially). The default shadcn/ui theme retains its existing dark mode support.

- **FR-012**: System MUST allow theme preview without affecting the current user's active theme selection

### Key Entities
- **Theme**: A complete set of visual design tokens that transform the appearance of all UI components (Foundation, Pathways, or Professional)
- **Design Token**: An atomic design value (color, spacing, typography) that can be customized per theme
- **Theme Variant**: A variation of a theme (e.g., light or dark mode within each educational theme)
