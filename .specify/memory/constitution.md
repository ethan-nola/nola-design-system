# NOLA Design System Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Upstream-First Component Architecture
All UI components MUST begin with unmodified shadcn/ui components, blocks, and patterns as the foundation. Core component implementations SHALL NOT contain custom inline styling beyond CSS token-based references. Theme customizations MUST be applied through a separate theming layer that preserves component integrity. No modifications to core component logic or structure are permitted without upstream validation.

*Rationale: Maintains compatibility with shadcn/ui ecosystem updates, ensures component reliability, and enables seamless integration with the broader shadcn community.*

### II. Theme-Component Separation
A strict separation MUST be maintained between core components and theming layers. Themes SHALL be applied exclusively through CSS custom properties and Tailwind configuration variables. Components MUST NOT contain theme-specific logic or hardcoded styling values. All visual customization MUST occur through the educational theming system (Foundation, Pathways, Professional) without modifying core component files.

*Rationale: Enables theme switching, supports multiple educational contexts, and maintains component reusability across different educational age groups.*

### III. Registry Publishing Compliance
All components, themes, and patterns MUST be compatible with the shadcn/ui registry publishing system. Component definitions MUST include proper JSON manifest entries with accurate dependency declarations. Registry distributions MUST maintain backward compatibility with standard shadcn CLI installation procedures. Theme packages MUST be distributable as independent registry entries.

*Rationale: Ensures compatibility with the established shadcn ecosystem and enables seamless component distribution to consuming projects.*

### IV. Research-Driven Development
No custom solutions or architectural decisions SHALL be implemented without prior research into existing patterns and best practices. All development approaches MUST be validated against current industry standards and proven implementations. Before creating new patterns, existing shadcn/ui community solutions MUST be evaluated and documented. Innovation MUST build upon established foundations rather than replacing them.

*Rationale: Leverages community wisdom, reduces technical debt, and ensures long-term maintainability by following proven patterns.*

### V. Quality-First Implementation
No tasks SHALL be marked complete without proper implementation following established best practices. Band-aid fixes and temporary workarounds are PROHIBITED in favor of robust, tested solutions. All components MUST include comprehensive tests that validate both functionality and adherence to these constitutional principles. Code reviews MUST verify compliance with upstream patterns and educational accessibility requirements.

*Rationale: Ensures educational platform reliability, maintains code quality standards, and provides confidence in component behavior across different educational contexts.*

## Educational Requirements

All components and themes MUST support three distinct educational contexts with appropriate accessibility considerations:

- **Foundation Theme**: Middle school users (ages 11-14) with larger touch targets, higher contrast, and engaging visual elements
- **Pathways Theme**: High school users (ages 14-18) with modern design patterns and collaborative features
- **Professional Theme**: Post-graduate users (ages 18+) with sophisticated, information-dense layouts

WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is MANDATORY across all themes with additional considerations for cognitive accessibility in educational contexts.

## Development Standards

All code MUST follow the established project conventions:

- TypeScript strict mode with comprehensive type safety
- Storybook-driven component development with interactive documentation
- Vitest testing with browser-based component validation
- ESLint and Prettier enforced code standards
- Conventional commit messages with semantic versioning

Registry builds MUST generate valid JSON manifests compatible with shadcn CLI consumption patterns.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and design decisions. Any amendments MUST be documented with clear rationale, approved through proper channels, and include migration plans for existing code. All pull requests MUST be validated against these principles before merge approval.

Version control and change management follow semantic versioning principles with special attention to educational platform stability requirements. Complex architectural decisions MUST be justified against these core principles with documented trade-off analysis.
