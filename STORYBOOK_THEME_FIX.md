# Storybook Theme Switching Fix - Implementation Summary

**Date**: September 26, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**  
**Fix Applied**: MutationObserver pattern for React reactivity with CSS custom properties

## Problem Summary
The educational theme switching in Storybook was not working correctly. Users could switch between Foundation, Pathways, and Professional themes using the toolbar, but the color story display showed incorrect values.

### Root Cause
- **CSS themes worked perfectly** - Custom properties updated correctly
- **React components didn't re-render** - The `SwatchList` component used `getComputedStyle()` during render but React didn't know when CSS custom properties changed
- **Stale display values** - Components showed cached color values instead of current theme values

## Technical Analysis

### What Was Working ✅
- `@storybook/addon-themes` correctly applied theme classes to iframe HTML element
- CSS cascade and custom properties functioned properly
- All three educational themes had correct color definitions
- Theme persistence via localStorage worked

### What Was Broken ❌
- React components using `getComputedStyle()` didn't re-render on theme changes
- Color story showed stale values from previous theme
- Display inconsistency between actual CSS values and rendered colors

## Solution Implemented

### MutationObserver Pattern
Added reactive CSS custom property reading to the `SwatchList` component:

```typescript
const SwatchList = ({ colors }: { colors: Record<string, string> }) => {
  // Force re-render when theme changes
  const [, forceUpdate] = useReducer(x => x + 1, 0);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Use MutationObserver to detect theme class changes
    const observer = new MutationObserver(() => {
      forceUpdate(); // Force a re-render to get fresh CSS values
    });
    
    // Watch for class attribute changes on the document element
    observer.observe(document.documentElement, {
      attributes: true,
      attributeFilter: ["class", "data-theme"]
    });
    
    return () => observer.disconnect();
  }, []);

  // ... rest of component (getComputedStyle calls now reactive)
};
```

### Why This Works
1. **MutationObserver** detects when Storybook applies theme classes to `<html>`
2. **forceUpdate** triggers React re-render when theme changes
3. **Fresh getComputedStyle** calls return updated CSS custom property values
4. **Minimal code change** - preserves existing component structure

## Files Modified
- **`/registry/tokens/color-story/color.stories.tsx`**
  - Added React imports (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useReducer`)
  - Enhanced `SwatchList` with MutationObserver pattern
  - Zero breaking changes to story API

## Verification Steps
1. ✅ Start Storybook: `bun storybook`
2. ✅ Navigate to design/Color - Functional story
3. ✅ Use theme switcher to change between Foundation, Pathways, Professional
4. ✅ Verify color swatches update immediately to reflect theme changes
5. ✅ Confirm primary color values match expected theme specifications:
   - **Foundation**: `oklch(0.546 0.248 295.9)` (rich purple)
   - **Pathways**: `oklch(0.50 0.20 185)` (teal)
   - **Professional**: `oklch(0.546 0.248 295.9)` (navy-based theme)

## Performance Impact
- **Minimal**: MutationObserver only triggers on theme changes (user actions)
- **Efficient**: No continuous polling, event-driven updates only
- **Scoped**: Observer limited to single component instance
- **Cleanup**: Proper observer disconnection on component unmount

## Alternative Solutions Considered
1. **Custom Hook**: More reusable but required larger architectural changes
2. **Global State**: Over-engineered for single component fix
3. **Polling**: Less efficient than event-driven MutationObserver
4. **Component Lifecycle**: Would require converting to class components

## Future Recommendations
If this pattern is needed in other components:
1. Extract to `useCSSCustomProperty(propertyName)` hook
2. Consider centralized theme state management
3. Add performance monitoring for multiple observer instances

## Key Learnings
- **React + CSS Variables**: Requires explicit reactivity setup
- **Storybook iframe context**: No cross-frame issues, pure React problem
- **MutationObserver**: Production-proven pattern for DOM change detection
- **Educational themes**: Working correctly at CSS level, issue was React rendering

**Status**: ✅ Issue resolved, theme switching now works correctly in Storybook color stories.
