# NOLA Design System - Development Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive development plan for extending the NOLA Design System into a complete organizational UI library for NOLA Education. The library will serve three distinct user groups through themed experiences: middle-schoolers (Foundation), high-schoolers (Pathways), and post-graduates (Professional).

---

## 1. Project Vision & Goals

### Primary Objectives
- Create a standardized UI component library for all NOLA Education applications
- Implement age-appropriate theming for different educational levels
- Maintain the ShadCN registry philosophy of open code and developer ownership
- Reduce design and development costs by up to 46% through component reuse
- Enable rapid application development while maintaining design consistency

### Core Principles
1. **Open Code**: All components distributed as source code, not compiled packages
2. **Composability**: Common interfaces across all components
3. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all educational levels
4. **Customization**: Full control over component implementation
5. **Education-First**: Design decisions prioritize learning outcomes

## 2. User Segmentation & Theme Strategy

### Theme Architecture

| Theme | User Group | Age Range | Design Philosophy | Key Characteristics |
|-------|------------|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Foundation** | Middle School | 11-14 | Engaging & Clear | • Larger touch targets<br>• Higher contrast<br>• Playful colors<br>• Clear visual hierarchy<br>• Gamification elements |
| **Pathways** | High School | 14-18 | Balanced & Modern | • Contemporary design<br>• Social features<br>• Flexible layouts<br>• Career exploration focus<br>• Collaborative tools |
| **Professional** | Post-Graduate | 18+ | Sophisticated & Efficient | • Information density<br>• Advanced features<br>• Minimal design<br>• Productivity focus<br>• Professional tools |

### Theme Implementation Strategy

#### Color Psychology by Theme

**Foundation Theme**
- Primary: Vibrant blue (trust, stability)
- Secondary: Warm purple (creativity, imagination)
- Accent: Soft green (growth, positivity)
- Success: Bright green (achievement)
- Warning: Friendly orange (attention without alarm)

**Pathways Theme**
- Primary: Modern teal (balance, clarity)
- Secondary: Deep purple (ambition, creativity)
- Accent: Energetic coral (enthusiasm, motivation)
- Success: Mint green (progress)
- Warning: Amber (caution, consideration)

**Professional Theme**
- Primary: Navy blue (professionalism, depth)
- Secondary: Slate gray (sophistication)
- Accent: Gold (achievement, excellence)
- Success: Forest green (growth, success)
- Warning: Deep orange (urgency, importance)

#### Typography Scaling

```
Foundation: Base 16px, Line Height 1.75, Letter Spacing +0.02em
Pathways:   Base 15px, Line Height 1.65, Letter Spacing +0.01em
Professional: Base 14px, Line Height 1.5, Letter Spacing normal
```
